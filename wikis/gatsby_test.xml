The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]. Set in the [[Music: Jazz Age]] on Long Island, 
near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator [[Nick Carraway]]'s interactions with mysterious millionaire 
Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan. The novel was inspired by a youthful 
romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 
1922. Following a move to the [[How to Travel to the French Riviera|French Riviera]], Fitzgerald completed a rough draft 
of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the 
following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book's 
title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's cover art greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he 
incorporated aspects of it into the novel. After its publication by [[Scribner's]] in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received 
generally favorable reviews, though some literary critics believed it did not equal Fitzgerald's previous efforts. Compared 
to his earlier novels, Gatsby was a commercial disappointment, selling fewer than 20,000 copies by October, and Fitzgerald's 
hopes of a monetary windfall from the novel were unrealized. When the author died in 1940, he believed himself to be a failure 
and his work forgotten.

How to Travel to the French Riviera

The French Riviera, also known as the Cote d-Azur, is a dreamy French region that extends east along the coast from Menton 
and Monaco to Theoule sur Mer and up into the Southern Alps. The Riviera contains several cities (Nice and Cannes among them), 
14 natural parks, Roman ruins, medieval villages, and whale watching just offshore. Don't think of the Cote d-Azur as just a 
summer locale, either. Sure, these cities heat up come July as the masses parade down boulevards and beaches, but winter is 
one of the Riviera's best-kept secrets with snow falling just two hours north of the shore. Here's how to make the most of 
your stay in the South of France.

In May 1924, Fitzgerald and his family moved abroad to Europe. He continued writing his third novel, which would eventually 
become his magnum opus [[The Great Gatsby]]. Fitzgerald had been planning the novel since 1923 when he told his publisher 
Maxwell Perkins of his plans to embark upon a work of art that would be beautiful and intricately patterned. He had already 
written 18,000 words for his novel by mid-1923 but discarded most of his new story as a false start. Initially titled 
Trimalchio—an allusion to the Latin work Satyricon—the plot followed the rise of a parvenu who seeks wealth to win the woman 
he loves. For source material, Fitzgerald drew heavily on his experiences on Long Island and once again on his lifelong 
obsession with his first love Ginevra King. "The whole idea of Gatsby", he later explained, "is the unfairness of a poor 
young man not being able to marry a girl with money. This theme comes up again and again because I lived it." Work on The 
Great Gatsby slowed while the Fitzgeralds sojourned on the [[How to Travel to the French Riviera|French Riviera]], where a 
marital crisis developed. Zelda became infatuated with a French naval aviator, Edouard Jozan. She spent afternoons swimming 
at the beach and evenings dancing at the casinos with him. After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Fitzgerald sought to 
confront Jozan and locked Zelda in their house until he could do so. Before any confrontation could occur, Jozan—who had no 
intention of marrying Zelda—left the Riviera, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Soon after, Zelda overdosed on sleeping 
pills. The couple never spoke of the incident, but the episode led to a permanent breach in their marriage. Jozan later 
dismissed the entire incident and claimed no infidelity or romance had occurred: "They both had a need of drama, they made it 
up, and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination."

In his narration, [[Nick Carraway]] explains that he was born in the Middle West. The Carraway family owned a hardware business 
(opened in 1851) and was something of an established family. Nick served in World War I in the Third Division, or Third Infantry 
Division. At a young age, his father advised him to reserve all judgments on people. After the war he moved from the Midwest to 
West Egg, a wealthy enclave of Long Island, to learn about the bond business. He takes up residence near his cousin, Daisy 
Buchanan and her affluent husband Tom, who was Nick's classmate at Yale University. They introduce him to their friend Jordan 
Baker, a cynical young heiress and golf champion. She and Nick begin a brief romance. Another neighbor and Daisy Buchanan's former 
lover, Jay [[The Great Gatsby|Gatsby]], invites Nick to one of his legendary parties. Nick is immediately intrigued by the 
mysterious socialite, especially when Gatsby introduces him to the gangster Meyer Wolfsheim, who is rumored to have helped 
Gatsby make his fortune in the bootlegging business. Gatsby takes a liking to Nick and confesses to him that he has been in love 
with Daisy since before the war and that his extravagant lifestyle is just an attempt to impress her. He asks Nick for his help 
in winning her over. Nick invites Daisy over to his house without telling her that Gatsby will be there. When Gatsby and Daisy 
resume their love affair, Nick serves as their confidant. Nick later discovers that Daisy struck and killed George's wife (and 
Tom's lover), Myrtle Wilson, in Gatsby's car. Tom then tells George that Gatsby had been driving the car. George then kills 
Gatsby and then himself. Nick holds a funeral for Gatsby, breaks up with Jordan, and decides to leave West Egg and return to 
his native Midwest, reflecting that the era of dreaming that Gatsby represented is over.

The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s and 1930s in which jazz music and dance styles rapidly gained nationwide popularity in 
the United States. The Jazz Age's cultural repercussions were primarily felt in the United States, the birthplace of jazz. 
Originating in New Orleans as mainly sourced from the culture of the diaspora, jazz played a significant part in wider cultural 
changes in this period, and its influence on popular culture continued long afterward. The [[Music: Jazz Age]] is often referred 
to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties, and in the United States, it overlapped in significant cross-cultural ways with 
the Prohibition Era. The movement was largely affected by the introduction of radios nationwide. During this time, the Jazz Age 
was intertwined with the developing youth culture. The movement also helped start the beginning of the European Jazz movement.
